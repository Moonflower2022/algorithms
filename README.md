# algorithms
My implementation of some interesting algorithms. 

* optimizers
  * gradient descent to solve linear and non-linear systems of equations, find roots of functions
  * line search for faster convergence than gradient descent
  * adagrad for faster convergence than gradient descent
  * alberth method for roots of polynomials/maybe other functions
  * my own approximation scheme for minimizing continuous functions
* area approximation schemes (riemann sums, monte carlo simulations)  
* euler's method for approximating solutions to differential equations
* determination of to and from positions for certain subtraction games (CGT)
* a dynamic programming solution to the knapsack problem
* sorting algorithms  
  * bubble sort  
  * counting sort  
  * insertion sort  
  * merge sort  
  * selection sort  
* an RSA implementation using the miller rabin primality test (WIP)
